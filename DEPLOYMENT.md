# Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Laravel + Netlify Compatibility Issue

**Netlify does NOT support PHP applications natively.** Your Laravel application will NOT work properly on Netlify because:

- Netlify only serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Laravel requires PHP server-side processing
- Database connections, authentication, and API routes will fail

## Recommended Deployment Platforms for Laravel:

### 1. **Vercel** (Recommended)
- Supports PHP/Laravel
- Easy GitHub integration
- Free tier available
- Command: Deploy directly from GitHub

### 2. **Railway**
- Full Laravel support
- PostgreSQL/MySQL databases
- Easy deployment
- Command: `railway login && railway deploy`

### 3. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- Laravel-optimized
- Managed databases
- Auto-scaling
- Deploy from GitHub

### 4. **Heroku**
- Classic Laravel hosting
- Add-ons for databases
- Buildpacks for PHP
- Command: `git push heroku main`

## If You Must Use Netlify (Static Only):

Your app will only serve static assets. To make it work:

1. Build static assets: `npm run build`
2. The `public/build` folder contains your CSS/JS
3. Only frontend functionality will work
4. No PHP/Laravel backend features

## Current Project Status:

✅ Dependencies resolved
✅ Build process working
✅ Static assets generated
❌ Will not work on Netlify (PHP required)

## Next Steps:

1. Choose a PHP-compatible platform
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure database connection
4. Deploy with proper Laravel support
